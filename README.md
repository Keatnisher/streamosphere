A cloud-based file storage system focused on streaming music and video.
<br />

<b>Technologies</b>: Golang with gin and mongo-go-driver, mongodb alongside firebase, and react.js.
<br />

<b>Backend</b>: Written in Golang with <i>gin</i> for http routing and api handling and the <i>mongo-go-driver</i> for interfacing with mongodb. Mongo db was the database of choice, used in conjunction with firebase for user authentication and authorization.
<br />

The frontend is written in React.js, with libraries such as <i>react-dom-router</i>, <i>react-media-player</i>, and <i>react-bootstrap</i> for styling among others.
<br />

Webpack was used for bundling all of the javascript together, and babel for the compiliation of course.
